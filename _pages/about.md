I am a Masterâ€™s student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University, where my research focuses on Machine Learning Systems. Currently, I am exploring system-level challenges in LLM reasoning. I am fortunate to work under the guidance of [Prof. Tushar Krishna](https://tusharkrishna.ece.gatech.edu/) and [Prof. Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io/).

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. There, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yu Wang](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) on neural architecture search and AI accelerator design.


**I am looking for PhD positions starting Fall 2025 and research internship opportunities for Summer 2025.**
